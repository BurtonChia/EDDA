{"name":"EDDA","tagline":"Experiment Design for Differential abundance Analysis","body":"EDDA is a tool for systematic assessment of the impact of experimental design and the statistical test used on the ability to detect differential abundance. EDDA can aid in the design of a range of common experiments such as RNA-seq, ChIP-Seq, Nanostring assays, RIP-seq and Metagenomic sequencing, and enables researchers to comprehensively investigate the impact of experimental decisions on the ability to detect differential abundance. More details of EDDA can be found at [_Luo, Huaien et al. “The Importance of Study Design for Detecting Differentially Abundant Features in High-Throughput Experiments.” Genome Biology 2014;15(12):527._](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25517037/)\r\n\r\nAn accompanying [web server](http://edda.gis.a-star.edu.sg/) is available for easy access to some functionality of EDDA.\r\nAdditionally a [Bioconductor package](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EDDA.html) is available for easy installation of EDDA R package.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
